# hello-world
Hello Humans!

I am the founder and President of Verriclear Natural Skin Essentials Ltd. (a.k.a. Verriclear™)

Headquartered in Canada and Brazil, Verriclear Natural Skin Essentials™ develops phytomedicinal skincare treatments from bioactive extracts of common and rare plants sourced worldwide.

### Mining the literature for phytomedicinal data as a process of discovery for breakthrough interventions in the pathogenesis of neglected skin diseases; an OpenNotebook study	

Verriclear™ is proud and honoured to announce our collaboration in an OpenNotebook study with two esteemed scientists from Cambridge University [Dr. Gitanjali Yadav, Ph.D., M.Sc., B.Sc.](www.nipgr.ac.in/research/dr_gyadav.php) Genome Biologist, and Lecturer University of Cambridge and [Peter Murray-Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Murray-Rust), Reader Emeritus in Molecular Informatics, Dept. Of Chemistry, University of Cambridge and Founder of ContentMine.org.

Enthusiastically aided by a team of dedicated scientists and student volunteers, in this groundbreaking research and development project, we will be creating a toolkit for searching and scraping high quality data from open science sources with the aim of developing efficacious, sustainable, affordable treatments for people suffering from [neglected skin diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Neglected_diseases) (“NSDs”) in marginalized markets (such as [Chromoblastomycosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromoblastomycosis), a fungal infection regionally endemic in developing countries) — the development of which we fund with revenues from our therapies that address pervasive skincare needs (“PSNs”) in global markets (such as [Acne Vulgaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne) and [Photoaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoaging)) — which is why we’ve chosen these conditions and their related symptoms as test cases for this project.

Verriclear’s mandate is to consistently bring to market new reliable, affordable innovations that deliver demonstrable results that industrial-scale competitor’s simply can’t. And yet, despite all the technological breakthroughs in data processing, one of the limits affecting our capacities to continually discover and develop new therapies are those restricting the speed of data aggregation and abstraction from high-quality research.

The proposed toolkit — we are calling, “D.A.V.E.” — is intended to Download, Abstract, Verify and Evaluate high quality open-source research data from which Verriclear™ will develop working phytomedicinal formulas that can truly make a difference.

By focusing on the speed at which millions of research papers available online can be automatically and intelligently analyzed for relevant “data signals”, “scraped” of selected keywords and data, and aggregated into organized tables to then be analyzed and integrated offline, Verriclear hopes to pioneer a repeatable process for near automated discovery of unique synergistic combinations of pure botanical extracts and/or their bioactive constituents holding untapped therapeutic potential, and turn what is currently an enormously time- and labour-intensive task into a quick, automated and reliable one. 

And in making public the steps we take in the development of this toolkit, we hope to forge a clear and broad trail by which fellow and future innovators may develop safer, more reliable and effective therapeutic solutions needed by humanity.

We invite you join, contribute to, or follow our journey of development and discovery in our OpenNotebook study on Github at https://github.com/petermr/CEVOpen.
